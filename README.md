# Holt

**The Enterprise-Grade AI Orchestrator for Secure, Auditable, and Compliant Workflows**

Holt enables organizations to safely automate complex software engineering tasks using AI agents—while maintaining complete control, security, and regulatory compliance.

---

## Enterprise-Ready by Design

Holt is an opinionated, integrated platform, purpose-built for secure and regulated environments. Its architecture provides enterprise-grade capabilities out-of-the-box.

*   **Absolute Data Sovereignty**: Holt is self-hosted by default, allowing for deployment in **air-gapped environments**. The entire platform runs on your infrastructure, ensuring no data, metadata, or logs ever leave your security perimeter.
*   **Unparalleled Auditability**: The central "Blackboard" acts as a chronological, append-only ledger, providing a complete audit trail of every action taken by every agent.

---

## Compliance and Security

Holt is architected to support the stringent security and compliance requirements of regulated industries. Its self-hosted nature, chronological audit trail, and declarative policies provide the foundation needed to build a compliant system.

For a detailed guide on how Holt's features map to the technical controls of frameworks like **HIPAA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001**, please read our full compliance guide:

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (20.10+) - For running agent containers
- **Git** (2.x+) - For workspace management
- **Go** (1.21+) - For building Holt binaries

### Installation & First Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dyluth/holt.git
cd holt

# 2. Build binaries
make build

# 3. Create test project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"

# 4. Initialize Holt
holt init

# 5. Build example git agent
docker build -t example-git-agent:latest -f agents/example-git-agent/Dockerfile ..

# 6. Configure agent in holt.yml
cat > holt.yml <<EOF
version: "1.0"
agents:
  git-agent:
    role: "Git Agent"
    image: "example-git-agent:latest"
    command: ["/app/run.sh"]
    workspace:
      mode: rw
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
EOF

# 7. Start Holt instance
holt up

# 8. Create workflow
holt forage --goal "hello.txt"

# 9. Watch agent execute
holt watch

# 10. View results
holt hoard
git log --oneline
ls -la hello.txt  # File created by agent!
```

**What just happened?**

1. Holt started an orchestrator and your git agent in Docker containers
2. The orchestrator created a claim for your goal ("hello.txt")
3. The git agent bid on and won the claim
4. The agent created `hello.txt` in your workspace and committed it
5. A `CodeCommit` artefact was created on the blackboard with the commit hash
6. Complete audit trail preserved in Redis and Git history

## How It Works: A Conceptual Overview

This diagram illustrates the high-level conceptual workflow of the Holt system, demonstrating how a user goal initiates a collaborative, auditable process between the orchestrator and a clan of specialized AI agents interacting via the central Redis Blackboard.

## Core Concepts

### The Blackboard

A Redis-based shared state system where all components interact. Think of it as a lightweight ledger storing:

- **Artefacts**: Append-only work products (code commits, designs, analyses)
- **Claims**: The orchestrator's decisions about work assignment
- **Bids**: Agents' expressions of interest in claims

Every interaction is timestamped and recorded, creating a chronological audit trail perfect for regulated environments.

### Artefacts

Append-only data objects representing work products. Each artefact has:

- **type**: User-defined (e.g., "CodeCommit", "DesignSpec", "TestReport")
- **payload**: Main content (commit hash, JSON data, text)
- **source_artefacts**: Dependency chain for provenance tracking
- **structural_type**: Role in orchestration (Standard, Review, Question, Answer, Failure, Terminal)

Artefacts never change. Instead, new versions form logical threads tracked via `logical_id`.

### Claims & Phased Execution

When an artefact is created, the orchestrator creates a **claim** and agents bid on it. Claims progress through phases:

1. **Review Phase**: Parallel review by multiple agents (Phase 3)
2. **Parallel Phase**: Concurrent work by multiple agents (Phase 3)
3. **Exclusive Phase**: Single agent gets exclusive access ✅ (Phase 2)

Agents submit bids ("review", "claim", "exclusive", "ignore") based on their capabilities and the work required.

### The Agent Pup

A lightweight Go binary that runs as the entrypoint in every agent container. It:

- Watches for claims via Pub/Sub
- Submits bids on behalf of the agent
- Assembles historical context via graph traversal
- Executes the agent's tool script with JSON contract
- Creates artefacts from tool output
- Operates concurrently to remain responsive

**Key insight:** The pup handles orchestration complexity. You just write the tool logic.

### Agents

Docker containers packaging:

1. **Agent pup binary** (handles Holt integration)
2. **Tool script** (your custom logic - shell, Python, anything)
3. **Dependencies** (LLM APIs, compilers, CLIs, etc.)

Agents communicate with the pup via stdin/stdout JSON:

**Input:**
```json
{
  "claim_type": "exclusive",
  "target_artefact": { "type": "GoalDefined", "payload": "build auth API", ... },
  "context_chain": [ /* historical artefacts */ ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "artefact_type": "CodeCommit",
  "artefact_payload": "abc123def456...",
  "summary": "Implemented authentication endpoints"
}
```

### Git-Centric Workflow

Holt assumes and requires a clean Git repository. Code artefacts are git commit hashes, and agents are responsible for:

- Creating or modifying files
- Committing changes with descriptive messages
- Returning commit hashes as `CodeCommit` artefacts

The pup validates commit hashes exist before creating artefacts, ensuring integrity.

### Human-in-the-Loop

Holt is designed for human oversight with first-class Question/Answer support (M4.1):

- **Question artefacts**: Agents can ask for clarification when encountering ambiguous requirements. Questions trigger the M3.3 automated feedback loop, terminating the questioning agent's claim and assigning rework to the original author.
- **Review phase**: Humans or review agents provide feedback before execution (M3.3)
- **Complete audit trail**: Every question and answer is captured as immutable artefacts, creating a full compliance history
- **Manual intervention**: Humans can inspect state and intervene at any point via CLI

**Example Q&A Flow**:
```bash
# Agent encounters ambiguous requirement and produces Question artefact
# Orchestrator emits HUMAN_INPUT_REQUIRED workflow event

# Human checks for questions
holt questions

# Human provides clarified requirements
holt answer abc-123 "Build REST API with JWT authentication"

# Orchestrator creates new version of the questioned artefact with answer
# New claim is created for the clarified requirements
```

Questions are treated as "late review feedback" - rather than pausing workflows, the original artefact is superseded with a clarified version, maintaining agent statelessness and preventing Q&A chain pollution.

### Interactive Debugging

Holt provides traditional breakpoint-based debugging for AI agent workflows (M4.2):

- **Breakpoint control**: Pause workflows at specific conditions (artefact types, claim states, agent roles)
- **Real-time inspection**: Examine artefacts, claims, and workflow state while paused
- **Single-stepping**: Step through orchestrator events one at a time
- **Manual intervention**: Approve/reject reviews, terminate problematic claims
- **Safe sessions**: Ephemeral breakpoints, automatic cleanup, complete audit trail

**Key Commands**:
```bash
holt debug                             # Attach interactive debugger
holt debug -b artefact.type=CodeCommit # Set breakpoints on startup
```

**Safety Features**:
- Session heartbeat with 30-second TTL - auto-resumes if debugger crashes
- Single active session - prevents conflicting commands
- Complete audit trail - all manual interventions logged as immutable artefacts
- Context-aware commands - prevents mistakes (e.g., terminate only when paused on claim)

See **[docs/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md](./docs/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md)** for comprehensive workflows and examples.

## Building Custom Agents

### Minimal Echo Agent

**agents/my-agent/run.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
input=$(cat)

# Extract goal from payload
goal=$(echo "$input" | grep -o '"payload":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

echo "Processing: $goal" >&2

# Output result
cat <<EOF
{
  "artefact_type": "Processed",
  "artefact_payload": "Result for $goal",
  "summary": "Processing complete"
}
EOF
```

**agents/my-agent/Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY cmd/pup ./cmd/pup
COPY internal/pup ./internal/pup

## Example Agents

### Echo Agent
**Location:** `agents/example-agent/`

Simple agent demonstrating basic stdin/stdout contract. Reads goal, logs it, outputs success artefact.

**Use case:** Learning, testing, proof-of-concept

### Git Agent
**Location:** `agents/example-git-agent/`

Creates files in workspace and commits them, returning `CodeCommit` artefacts.

**Use case:** Code generation, file creation, project scaffolding

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Build agent
docker build -t example-git-agent:latest -f agents/example-git-agent/Dockerfile .

# Start Holt
holt up

# Create file via agent
holt forage --goal "implementation.go"

# Verify result
git log --oneline  # Shows commit by agent
ls implementation.go  # File exists
holt hoard  # Shows CodeCommit artefact
```

## Guiding principles


### Pragmatism over Novelty (YAGNI)

We use battle-hardened tools (Docker, Redis, Git) rather than building custom solutions. Holt is an orchestrator, not a database or container runtime.

### Zero-Configuration, Progressively Enhanced

`holt init && holt up` creates a working system. Smart defaults cover 90% of use cases. Advanced features available when needed.

### Auditability as a Core Feature

The Holt platform treats artefacts as write-once records. Every decision is recorded on the blackboard with timestamps. Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging.

### Small, Single-Purpose Components

Each component (orchestrator, CLI, agent pup) has one job and does it excellently. Complexity is managed through composition.

### Container-Native by Design

Agents can use any tool that can be containerized - not just Python functions. This enables orchestration of compilers, CLIs, infrastructure tools, and more.

---

## Roadmap

Holt is being developed through a series of well-defined phases, from the initial "Heartbeat" to a fully "Kubernetes-Native" platform. For a detailed overview of the project's phased delivery plan and future direction, please see our comprehensive roadmap:

## Git Workspace Management

### Git Worktrees for Agent Isolation

**Context**: Currently, agents share a single workspace and use `git checkout <commit>` to work on specific commits. This can leave the workspace in detached HEAD state and requires careful coordination.

**Idea**: Use git worktrees to give each agent an isolated workspace:

```bash
# Agent creates temporary worktree
worktree_path="/workspace/.holt-worktrees/$AGENT_NAME-$CLAIM_ID"
git worktree add "$worktree_path" "$commit_hash"
cd "$worktree_path"

# Work on files in isolation
# ... agent work ...

# Cleanup
cd /workspace
git worktree remove "$worktree_path"
```

**Benefits**:
- **True isolation**: Multiple agents can work on different commits simultaneously without conflicts
- **Cleaner workspace state**: Main workspace stays on its original branch
- **Safer concurrent execution**: No risk of one agent's checkout interfering with another
- **Better debugging**: Each worktree is independent, easier to inspect

**Challenges**:
- **Complexity**: Agents need to manage worktree lifecycle (create, work, cleanup)
- **Disk space**: Each worktree is a full checkout (though sharing git objects)
- **Path management**: Agents must be aware they're working in a subdirectory
- **Container mounts**: Need to ensure worktree paths are within mounted volume
- **Error handling**: Cleanup must be robust (what if agent crashes mid-work?)

**Current Solution**:
Terminal agents (e.g., ModulePackager) update the main branch pointer and checkout main after completion. This is simple and solves the detached HEAD UX issue for demos.

**When to Revisit**:
- When we need higher concurrency (e.g., dozens of parallel agents)
- When implementing advanced branching strategies (feature branches, PRs)
- When git state conflicts become a production issue
- Phase 5+ when scaling becomes a priority

**Design Considerations**:
- Should worktree management be in the pup, or left to agent scripts?
- How to handle cleanup on agent crash or timeout?
- Should we use a shared worktree pool, or create/destroy per-claim?
- What's the performance impact of worktree creation vs checkout?

## Advanced Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Context**: As Holt is adopted in larger organizations, there is a need to control who can perform specific actions. Currently, any user with access to the CLI can run any command.
**Idea**: Implement a comprehensive RBAC system for the Holt CLI and potentially the orchestrator. This would involve defining roles (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `auditor`) and associating them with specific permissions.
**Benefits**:
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized users from performing destructive actions (e.g., `holt down --force` on a production instance).
- **Compliance**: Allows organizations to enforce separation of duties. An `auditor` role could have read-only access to the blackboard, while a `developer` role could run `forage` but not modify production instances.
**Challenges**:
- Requires an identity and authentication system.
- Permission model needs to be designed carefully to be flexible but not overly complex.
- Enforcement would need to happen at both the CLI and orchestrator levels.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is being deployed in multi-team environments or when production security becomes a primary concern.

### Secrets Management Integration

**Context**: Agents often require secrets like API keys, database credentials, or private SSH keys. The current method of using environment variables in `holt.yml` is not secure for production environments as it stores secrets in plaintext.
**Idea**: Integrate Holt with enterprise-standard secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets. The agent pup would be responsible for securely fetching secrets at runtime.
**Benefits**:
- **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are not stored in plaintext in the Git repository.
- **Centralized Management**: Enterprises can manage secrets using their existing, audited tools.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Supports solutions that provide short-lived, dynamically generated credentials.
**Challenges**:
- Requires building pluggable integrations for different secret backends.
- The agent pup needs a secure identity to authenticate with the secrets manager.
**When to Revisit**: Before any serious production deployment that involves agents handling sensitive credentials.

## Sophisticated Workflow & Resource Management

### Workflow Priority Queues

**Context**: Currently, the orchestrator processes goals in the order they are received. In a busy system, a critical production hotfix could be queued behind routine, low-priority tasks.
**Idea**: Introduce a `priority` field for goals submitted via `holt forage`. The orchestrator would maintain priority queues and service higher-priority claims first.
**Benefits**:
- **Improved Responsiveness**: Ensures that urgent tasks are addressed immediately.
- **Better Resource Allocation**: Allows operators to manage system load more effectively by prioritizing critical workflows.
**Challenges**:
- Requires significant changes to the orchestrator's claim processing logic.
- Needs a strategy to prevent starvation of low-priority tasks.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is used to manage a high volume of concurrent workflows with varying business importance.

### Parameterized Workflows

**Context**: Workflows are currently triggered with a static text goal. To reuse a workflow for a slightly different purpose, a new goal must be manually crafted.
**Idea**: Allow `holt forage` to accept structured parameters, e.g., `holt forage --goal "deploy-service" --param service=api --param version=1.2.3`. The agent tools would then receive these parameters in their input context.
**Benefits**:
- **Reusability**: Workflows become reusable templates that can be invoked with different inputs.
- **Automation**: Enables easier integration with external systems (like a CI/CD pipeline) that can trigger Holt workflows with specific parameters.
**Challenges**:
- The `GoalDefined` artefact schema would need to be updated to support parameters.
- The agent tool contract would need to be extended to include this new context.
**When to Revisit**: When users start building libraries of common, reusable workflows.

## Deeper Auditability & Compliance

### Digital Artefact Signing

**Context**: While the blackboard provides an audit trail, high-stakes industries (finance, pharma) may require cryptographic proof of an artefact's origin and integrity.
**Idea**: Require agents to digitally sign the artefacts they produce using a key (e.g., GPG, JWT). The orchestrator would verify this signature before accepting the artefact onto the blackboard.
**Benefits**:
- **Non-repudiation**: Provides cryptographic proof that a specific agent created a specific artefact.
- **Enhanced Integrity**: Guarantees that artefacts have not been tampered with after creation.
**Challenges**:
- Requires a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to manage agent keys.
- Adds computational overhead for signing and verification.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is being considered for use cases with stringent regulatory or legal requirements for data integrity.

### Automated Compliance Reporting

**Context**: While `holt hoard` allows for raw data export, compliance officers often need summarized, human-readable reports.
**Idea**: Create a new command, `holt audit report`, that generates a summary report of all activity over a given period. The report would include metrics like workflows started, success/failure rates, number of human interventions (Q&A), and a list of all terminal artefacts.
**Benefits**:
- **Streamlines Compliance**: Radically simplifies the process of generating audit reports.
- **Provides Business Insights**: Offers a high-level view of the system's performance and efficiency.
**Challenges**:
- The report format needs to be designed carefully to be useful to a non-technical audience.
- Aggregating data across many workflows could be computationally intensive.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is adopted by teams with dedicated compliance or audit functions.

## High Availability & Scalability

### High-Availability (HA) Orchestrator

**Context**: The current orchestrator is a single point of failure. If it crashes, the entire Holt instance stops processing new work.
**Idea**: Implement a high-availability model for the orchestrator, such as an active-passive or active-active configuration using a leader election protocol (e.g., via Redis locks or a library like etcd).
**Benefits**:
- **Resilience**: The system can automatically recover from the failure of a single orchestrator node.
- **Zero Downtime**: Enables rolling upgrades of the orchestrator without interrupting workflow processing.
**Challenges**:
- Leader election and state reconciliation are complex distributed systems problems.
- Requires careful management of the orchestrator's in-memory state.
**When to Revisit**: When Holt is used to run business-critical, long-running production workflows that cannot tolerate downtime.

### Pluggable Blackboard Backend

**Context**: Holt is currently tied to Redis as its blackboard. While Redis is highly performant, some enterprises may have different requirements or existing infrastructure (e.g., a preference for etcd, or a need for a managed cloud database).
**Idea**: Refactor the `pkg/blackboard` client to be an interface. Redis would be the default implementation, but other backends could be developed and plugged in.
**Benefits**:
- **Flexibility**: Allows Holt to be adapted to different enterprise environments and requirements.
- **Scalability**: Enables the use of globally distributed databases for massive-scale, multi-region deployments.
**Challenges**:
- Requires a carefully designed, generic interface that doesn't leak Redis-specific concepts.
- Each new backend is a significant development effort.
**When to Revisit**: When enterprise customers with specific data store requirements emerge, or when a single Redis instance becomes a scalability bottleneck.

## holt logs
allow the user to use the holt cli to get the logs from the agent - this was originally scheduled for m3.10 but was missed/dropped by the looks of things (I think this could be got from the docker container, but i migt be wromg - we need to dig into this more - especially when the interface between pup and the tool it calls is via stdin/out)

## cryptographically certain audit trail

for secure environments, we need to have our audit log & artefacts Cryptographically secure.
this means: Artefacts & bids must be signed by the agents, grants and Claims must be signed by the orchestrator.
Some sort of truly immutable datastore.. eg Blockchain instead of Redis for objects... ????!?

1. **Context**: audit log is the key value proposition for finance.
2. **Idea**: we need to have our audit trail be  cryptographically certain - so that when they are audited, the banks have certainty there was no tampering.
3. **Benefits**: Critical for having confidence that the solution works.
4. **Challenges**: What makes this hard?
5. **Current Solution**: How are we handling this now?
6. **When to Revisit**: Under what conditions should we implement this?
7. **Design Considerations**: 
- confirm how searchable this is - for speed - searching and querying artefacts is done a LOT - so it needs to be fast.  
- We also need to know how scalable this needs to be - can we have all the analysis done on one blockchain? or will that explode somewhere?  
- Does all info need to be on the blockchain? (eg cached context)  or do we need to still include redis
- how do we get the notifications done? - do we need Redis still for notificaion channel?

## Mandatory human/external approval step

Some processes need t interract with a human to get explicit approval.  This could be implemented as an Agent that bids on a claim to review it and then hooks into some interraction with a human rather than an automated process.

however it might also be useful to have this built in via a similar mechanism to the debugger.
This could possibly also appear as a change/enhancement to the `questions` behaviour - where rather than escalate to the agent that created the artefact, it is directly escalated to a human via some mechanism/integration - for human oversight.
